          Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have 
          something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.
      </p>
      <p class="quote" id="quote-2">
          Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. 
          Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. 
          Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. 
          And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. 
          They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.
